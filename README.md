# 👋 Hi there, I’m Debangsha Sarkar

- 👀 I’m interested in 2D and 3D computer vision, natural language processing, and immersive technology such as augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR).
- 💼 I have two master's degrees from the University of British Columbia. The first one is in Master of Data Science (MDS), which is a course-based graduate program. My latest master's degree is a Master of Science (M.Sc.) in Computer Science, focusing on Machine Learning (ML).
- 🧐 My mission is to use artificial intelligence to solve real-world problems.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning blockchain because it has many applications in deep learning. 
- 🧾 PUBLICATIONS:
  - ***Novel Representative Sampling for Improved Active Learning* in MATHMOD 2022 (https://www.mathmod.at/).
